# Relative-LENA

Relative-LENA should allow to perform relative NAA analysis by returning results (concentration of target elements) together with compiled uncertainty budgets aderent to the prescriptions reported in the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)

A python3.6 compiler, or higher, is needed to run the "R-LENA.py" script.

It is possible to freely download python compiler at "https://www.python.org/downloads/". During the python compiler installation please click the "Add python3.x to PATH" checkbox.
In order to correctly run the script, a few specific python modules (tkinter, xlrd, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, csv, xlsxwriter) are required. This are checked and installed at first start-up if a working internet connection is established.

To start the script, double-click the "R-LENA.py" file (tested on Windows 7 and 10). To open the script in text mode in order to modify it, recall "R-LENA.py" and/or "rnaaobj.py" with any IDE or text editor.
